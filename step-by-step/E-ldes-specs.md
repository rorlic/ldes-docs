# LDES Specification Basics
The [LDES specification](https://w3id.org/ldes/specification) is built on top of the [TREE specification](https://w3id.org/tree/specification), which defines some fundamental concepts on which LDES is built.

The LDES specification defines an `ldes:EventStream` to be a `tree:Collection` whose members are _immutable_. This basically means that an event stream contains things that do not change, that is, _versions_ of an object, and that these object versions cannot be updated or deleted from the LDES. In other words, an LDES is an append-only collection of immutable (version) objects, which represents their subsequent states, or put differently, the history of these things.

## Empty LDES
As you can imagine, an empty LDES looks similar to an empty TREE collection, except for its type:
```
@prefix ldes: <https://w3id.org/ldes#> .
@prefix ex:   <http://example.org/> .

ex:DisneyFeed a ldes:EventStream .
```
> [!TIP]
> We do not need to double type the data set with `tree:Collection` as this is [implied](https://github.com/SEMICeu/LinkedDataEventStreams/blob/b9c0d747e8d0cb6cb2b0215c758252cf95c30cda/vocabulary.ttl#L34).

```

## Relating and Sorting Members
We need a way to know which members (version objects) represent the states of the same thing. The [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) vocabulary defines exactly what we need: a [`dct:isVersionOf`](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/terms/isVersionOf/) predicate which defines the relation between a resource (the version) and the resource (the thing) it is a version of.

But, in order to have a history of a thing, we also need to know which version comes first and which version is a later state of that thing. So, we need a predicate that allows us to sort the versions by time. We can use the `dct:created` predicate to hold a date and time (timestamp) value for each version. Alternatively, we can use the [provenance](https://www.w3.org/ns/prov#) vocabulary and take the `prov:generatedAtTime` predicate instead.

Now, how does a data client know which property to use for grouping (relating) and sorting? To allow this, the LDES specification defines two (optional) predicates on an `ldes:EventStream`: the `ldes:versionOfPath` and the `ldes:timestampPath`. The data publisher can choose the predicates freely but usually the `dct:isVersionOf` and the `dct:created` suffice. 

> [!TIP]
> A data client needs both predicates to reconstruct the history of things in the correct order, so it is advised to include both.

The `ldes:timestampPath` must be a [SHACL property path](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#property-paths) that, when applied to a member, refers to a `xsd:dateTime` value (see [ISO 8601 date and time representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations)) indicating the order in which members are added to the event stream.

> [!NOTE]
> Each member should contain a value for the `ldes:timestampPath` predicate path and no member should be added to the event stream with a timestamp earlier that the last published member.

```

We also added a `tree:shape` to communicate to the data client that this event stream holds data items of type (schema) person.

    blank -- sh:targetClass --> person
    disney -- ldes:timestampPath --> created
    disney -- ldes:versionOfPath --> version
```

## Naming Members
Now, before we add members to an LDES we need to look into how we name and represent a member, which, as we already know, is a version of a thing. To machines it does not matter how such a member is named but us humans like structure so what you would typically do is take the URI of the original entity and append a version identifier to it, i.e. a timestamp value. This makes a version's identifier unique while it is still readable and even visually sortable.

For example, given an entity identified by some URI such as `http://example.org/thing/1` and given some version value such as `2000-01-01T15:00:00` we typically create a member identifier by appending a separator ('#' or similar) and the timestamp value to the URI, resulting in `http://example.org/thing/1#2000-01-01T15:00:00`.

```

We have two versions of both Mickey and Minnie. The second Minnie version simply adds her garderobe while in the second Mickey version the garderobe has different colors.

## Fetching an LDES
A last question we need to answer is: how do we retrieve an LDES? Actually, that is super trivial: we simply use the [HTTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) to request the LDES using a standard [GET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Request_methods) method and we provide the [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of the serialization format we would like to receive, (e.g. `text/turtle` for Turtle).

For example, if we assume that an LDES is available at http://my-domain.org/ldes/disney we can run the following command in a terminal window:
```
curl "http://my-domain.org/ldes/disney" -X GET -H "content-type: text/turtle"
```
> [!TIP]
> You can request the LDES using any internet browser as well, but it is non-trivial to request a specific serialization. The LDES server will return it in its default RDF serialization.

An implementation of an LDES server can choose at what HTTP endpoint it offers an LDES. The LDES specification does not impose any restrictions on the actual API of an LDES server: it only defines the content of an LDES. Actually, the LDES specification only defines a generic way to retrieve an LDES using the HTTP protocol.

As you can see in the example above, even the human readable Turtle format is pretty verbose. This is not related to LDES specific but rather to linked data in general. In order to have unambiguous semantics we need this verbosity. But, is that not a small price to pay for great interoperability?

## Summary
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The LDES specification defines that an _`ldes:EventStream` contains immutable members_ and communicates to data clients _how versions of a thing can be grouped and sorted_.

The [LDES vocabulary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEMICeu/LinkedDataEventStreams/b9c0d747e8d0cb6cb2b0215c758252cf95c30cda/vocabulary.ttl) formally defines all the concepts in detail.
