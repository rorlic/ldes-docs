# LDES - Step-by-step Guide
This guide provides a gentle and stepwise introduction into Linked Data Event Streams as defined in the [LDES specification](https://w3id.org/ldes/specification).

The recommended way is to read the above topics in order, but feel free to skip the topics that you are already familiar with:

1. [Why do we need LDES?](./A-why-do-we-need-ldes.md)
2. [What is LDES?](./B-what-is-ldes.md)
3. [Linked Data Basics](./C-linked-data-basics.md)
4. [TREE Specification Basics](./D-tree-specs.md)
5. [LDES Specification Basics](./E-ldes-specs.md)
6. [TREE Partitioning Basics](./F-tree-partitioning.md)
7. [TREE Partitioning Types](./G-tree-partitioning-types.md)
8. [TREE Time-based View](./H-time-based-view.md)
9. [TREE Geo-spatial View](./I-geospatial-view.md)
10. [TREE Reference-based View](./J-reference-based-view.md)
11. [LDES Retention Policies](./K-retention-policies.md)
12. [LDES Point-in-time Retention](./L-point-in-time-retention.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This step-by-step guide is currently work-in-progress and will very soon be extended with information on the following topics: retention policies, metadata, client behavior and a further reading section, so stay tuned!
