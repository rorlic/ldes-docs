# LDES - Step-by-step Guide
This guide provides a gentle and stepwise introduction into Linked Data Event Streams as defined in the [LDES specification](https://w3id.org/ldes/specification).

The recommended way is to read the above topics in order, but feel free to skip the topics that you are already familiar with:

2. [What is LDES?](./B-what-is-ldes.md)
3. [Linked Data Basics](./C-linked-data-basics.md)
4. [TREE Specification Basics](./D-tree-specs.md)
5. [LDES Specification Basics](./E-ldes-specs.md)
6. [TREE Partitioning Basics](./F-tree-partitioning.md)
7. [TREE Partitioning Types](./G-tree-partitioning-types.md)
8. [TREE Time-based View](./H-time-based-view.md)
